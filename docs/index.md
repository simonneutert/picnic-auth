# Stupidly Simple Authentication

Inspired by [Moron CMS](https://github.com/rabocalypse/moroncms), we developed
Picnic Auth!

A single user authentication service that is simple and fun - like a picnic.

## Just three simple steps

2. Run/Host the code.
3. Authenticate.

## Three key features

1. **Simple**: A single user.\
   Secret and password managed via environment variables.
2. **Secure**: Production-ready security with rate limiting, input validation, PBKDF2 key derivation, and timing attack protection.
3. **Lightweight**: It's a small and fast service compile and run (everywhere).

## Elevator Pitch

Not everyone needs a full-blown authentication service. Sometimes you just need
something that works and is easy to set up and protect your website or web
application (or just parts of it).

Picnic Auth is a simple authentication service that you can run and use for your
website or web application.

The app and user/password is preconfigured via a handful environment variables.

First authenticate with your username and password, then use the JWT token you
received.

Runs on every major platform, no need for a database, and no need for a complex
setup.
