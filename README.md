#### The Stupidly Simple Authentication Server<!-- omit from toc -->

This project is a [Deno ðŸ¦•](https://deno.com) server that handles authentication using bearer tokens. It includes routes for user authentication, JWT (Bearer) validation functionality.

Do not take this project too seriously. It is a simple project to demonstrate how to use JWTs for authentication in Deno.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install Deno if you haven't already.

3. Run the server.

   ```sh
   deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env server.ts
   ```

## Usage

The server exposes three main routes for authentication:

- `/auth` - Handles user authentication.
- `/auth/bearer` - Validates bearer tokens.

## Routes

CORS is set to "*" for all routes. This means that the server will accept requests from any origin. This may not be what you want for production use.

### POST `/auth`

Authenticates the user and returns a bearer token.

- **Request Body**: JSON object containing `username` and `password`.
- **Response**: JSON object containing the bearer token.

### POST `/auth/bearer`

Validates the provided bearer token.

- **Headers**: `Authentication` header with the bearer token.
- **Response**: JSON object containing user information if the token is valid.

## Environment Variables

The server uses environment variables for configuration. You can set these
variables in a `.env` file or directly in your environment.

- `PICNIC_USERNAME` - The username for authentication.\
  (Default: "picnic")
- `PICNIC_PASSWORD_BCRYPT` - The hashed password for authentication.\
  (Default: "mypicnic")
- `PICNIC_JWT_SECRET` - The secret key for signing JWT tokens.
- `PICNIC_JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME` - The duration for which the bearer token is valid.\
  (Default: "60m")
- `PICNIC_PORT` - The port on which the server will run. (Default: 8000)
- `CORS_ORIGIN` - The origin that is allowed to access the server.\
  (Default: "*")

### JWT Expiration Time Settings

The `PICNIC_JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME` environment variable should be a string that is an Integer followed by a time unit.
